    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <div id="coursedesc">
        Machine learning has become an indispensable tool for creating intelligent applications, accelerating scientific
        discoveries, and making better data-driven decisions. Yet the automation and scaling of such tasks can have
        troubling negative societal impacts. Through practical case studies, you will identify issues of fairness,
        justice, and truth inherent in AI applications. You will then apply recent techniques to detect and mitigate such
        algorithmic biases, along with methods that provide more transparency and explainability to state-of-the-art ML
        models. Finally, you will derive fundamental formal results on the limits of such techniques, along with
        tradeoffs that must be made for their practical application.

    <h2>Stanford Honor Code</h2>
    <div id="honorcodedesc">
        Students are free to form study groups and may discuss
    homeworks, projects, and assignments in groups. However, for
    homeworks, each student must write down
        the solutions and code from scratch independently, without referring to any written notes from the joint
        session. In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by
        themselves. It is an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a
        previous year or any other source, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online,
        and solutions you or someone else may have written up in a
    previous year, or from any other source. Furthermore, it is an honor code
        violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on
    a public git repo. You must explicitly cite any external content, research,
    code or other resources you use for your homeworks, analyses or projects. The Stanford Honor Code can be
        found <a href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code">here</a>. The Stanford
        Honor Code pertaining to CS courses can be found
        <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/handouts/honor-code.pdf">here</a>.

    <h2>AI Tool Policy </h2>
    <div id="aitoolpolicy">
    You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT as you would use a human collaborator. Soliciting direct answers or duplicating responses from these tools is not allowed. Any interactions with these tools must be credited as if they were contributions from collaborators. Using generative AI tools to essentially complete any part of an assignment or project is forbidden and will be considered a breach of the honor code. For additional information, see Generative AI Policy Guidance <a href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/generative-ai-policy-guidance">here</a>.
<br> <br> When submitting your assignment to Gradescope, you must attach any chat transcript directly related to your assignment. We will be tolerant for actions taken in good faith. You can either add screenshots of the transcripts at the end of your submission, or attach a separate pdf file. We may later adjust the policy should we find the AI tool usage undermines the educational value.
</div>
<h2> Lecture Attendance </h2>
    <div id="attendance">
        We require in-person lecture attendance.
        Specifically, the two socio-technical analyses dates will include in-class
        projects. More broadly, class participation and in-class discussions will count toward the final grade.

            staff, and/or faculty), but the primary participants will be
            registered students. Out of courtesy, we would appreciate that you
            first email us or talk to the instructor after the first class you
            attend. If the class is too full and we're running out of
            space, we would ask that you please allow registered students to attend.
