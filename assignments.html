<h2>Collaboration Policy and Honor Code</h2>
You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects. However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently without referring to any notes from the joint session. You should not copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers from previous years’ homeworks. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year’s solutions, either official or written up by another student. Anybody violating the honor code will be referred to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
<hr/>
<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

We will be using the <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">GradeScope</a> online submission system. All students (non-SCPD and SCPD) should submit their assignments electronically via GradeScope. Students can typeset or scan their homeworks.<br><br>

To register for GradeScope,

<ul>
    <li>Create an account on GradeScope if you don’t have one already.
    <li>Here are some <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs228/submitting_hw_guide.pdf">tips</a> for submitting through Gradescope.
</ul>


<b>Written Assignments:</b> Homeworks should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. You are encouraged to use LaTeX to writeup your homeworks, but this is not a requirement.<br><br>
<b>Late Homework:</b> You have <b>4</b> late days which you can use at any time during the term without penalty. For a particular homework, you can use only two late days. Once you run out of late days, your assignment will not be accepted. Each late homework should be clearly marked as “Late” on the first page. No late days is allowed for deadlines related to the course project.<br><br>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b> You may submit a regrade request if you believe that the course staff made an error in grading. Any regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Please try to be as specific as possible with your regrade request.<br><br>
